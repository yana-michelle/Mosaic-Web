	<div class="ourBelie">Our Beliefs</div>
		<div class="belief">WE BELIEVE in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament as inspired by God, and inerrant in the original writing. Scripture is the supreme and final authority in faith and life. Scripture is useful to believers for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness.

WE BELIEVE in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

WE BELIEVE in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, and in His ascension to the right hand of the Father.

WE BELIEVE that man was created in the image of God, but because of sin, was alienated from God. Only through faith, trusting in Christ alone for salvation, which was made possible by His death and resurrection, are we reconciled to God.

WE BELIEVE in the eternal life of the saved and the eternal punishment of the lost.

WE BELIEVE the Lord Jesus Christ commanded all believers to make disciples of every nation, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and to teach all that Christ had commanded.

WE BELIEVE Jesus Christ will come again to the earth in power and glory both personally and visibly â€“ to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.</div>
