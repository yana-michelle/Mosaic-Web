<br>is to create a church where people can come just as they are and belong before they have to believe

	<div class="ourBelief">OUR BELIEFS</div>
		<div class="belief"><b>we believe</b> in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament as inspired by God, and inerrant in the original writing. Scripture is the supreme and final authority in faith and life. It is useful to believers for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness. <br><b>we believe</b> in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. <br><b>we believe</b> in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, and in His ascension to the right hand of the Father. <br><b>we believe</b> that man was created in His image, but because of sin, was alienated from God. Only through faith are we reconciled to God. <br><b>we believe</b> in the eternal life of the saved and the eternal punishment of the lost. <br><b>we believe</b> the Lord Jesus Christ commanded all believers to make disciples of every nation, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and to teach all that Christ had commanded. <br><b>we believe</b> Jesus Christ will come again to the earth in power and glory both personally and visibly â€“ to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.</div>
